# emotiondetect
Emotion Detection and Facial Recognition from OpenCV + MobileNet Tensorflow Image Classification


Potential improvements:  
Better dataset: more accurate classifications, higher resolution (although almost impossible to obtain).  
Different network architecture: more/less layers, adjusting training metrics,  alternate algorithm for classifications
